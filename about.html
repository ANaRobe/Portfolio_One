                <p class="spacing inside-box"> During my studies (SNSPA Bucharest - Bachelor degree in European Public Administration) I had to face the challenges of moving to the USA to gain professional experience there.
                I took every step independently - from applying for a visa, deciding on an employment contract, organizing the trip, accommodating and learning about immigration obligations, to protecting my rights.
                That was just the beginning because 3 years later I followed the same steps but in a completely new system whose official language I didn't know at the time -Germany.
                But my thirst of adventure and curiosity about unknown was persisting.
                I have traveled around the world and met a lot of circumstances where I got out of my comfort zone. 
                Those were the moments when I realised that I am natural in dealing with challenges. I chose now to have a career change in Web Development just because this field it is so vast and challenging.</p>
